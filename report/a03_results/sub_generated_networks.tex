% Generated Networks

For the benchmark study, a total of 50 synthetic Boolean networks were generated using the custom generator described in Section 2.1. The networks span 10 different dimensions, with 5 networks generated for each dimension.

\subsubsection{Network Dimensions}

The generated networks cover the following dimensions:

    \begin{tabular}{ccc}
        \hline
        \textbf{Dimension} & \textbf{Number of Networks} & \textbf{States per Network ($2^n$)} \\ \hline
        5D  & 5 & 32      \\
        6D  & 5 & 64      \\
        7D  & 5 & 128     \\
        8D  & 5 & 256     \\
        9D  & 5 & 512     \\
        10D & 5 & 1,024   \\
        11D & 5 & 2,048   \\
        12D & 5 & 4,096   \\
        13D & 5 & 8,192   \\
        16D & 5 & 65,536  \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Network Properties}

All networks share the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fixed dependency limit:} Each variable's update function depends on exactly 3 other variables.
    \item \textbf{Reproducibility:} Each network was generated with a unique random seed, ensuring exact reproducibility.
    \item \textbf{Boolean functions:} Update functions are represented in Sum-of-Products (SOP) form with 2--6 true outputs per function.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Rationale for Dimension Selection}

The dimension range from 5 to 16 was chosen to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Span tractable to challenging cases:} Lower-dimensional networks (5--7D) provide scenarios where reconstruction should be feasible, while higher-dimensional networks (13--16D) test the limits of the reconstruction algorithm.
    \item \textbf{Enable scaling analysis:} The exponential growth of state space ($2^n$) across dimensions allows for systematic evaluation of how reconstruction quality degrades with increasing network complexity.
    \item \textbf{Match biological relevance:} Many real biological signaling pathways involve 5--15 key regulatory components, making this range practically relevant.
\end{enumerate}
